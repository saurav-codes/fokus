    Generate focus cycles using the Camel Technique, correctly alternating between long and short focus cycles.

    Key features:
    1. Starts with longer focus cycles (90 minutes by default) that gradually decrease.
       but it will never go below 50 minutes and will never go above 95 minutes.
       and also it depends on the total time the user wants to focus. ideally
       it generates the long focus cylces like 50 60 or 90 but we can add extra
       time to the long focus cycles by distributing it to the long focus cycles
       and extend those long sessions upto +7 minutes max. so a 90 minutes cycle will
       be extended to 97 minutes max. also same way we can extend the short focus
       cycles upto +5 minutes max. but that max value for long and short focus can be
       CamelTechnique.get_long_focus_based_on_cycle_duration() +7 or
       CamelTechnique.get_short_focus_based_on_cycle_duration() +5
       also the distribution is controlled by distribute_extra_time_to_long_cycles: bool,
       distribute_extra_time_to_short_cycles: bool and distribute_extra_time_to_last_25_5_25_5_cycles: bool,
       if the user wants to distribute the extra time to the long focus cycles, short focus cycles
       or the final 25-5-25-5 cycles.

    2. Alternates between long and short (25-minute) focus cycles.
    3. Incorporates regular breaks (10 minutes after long focus cycles, 5 minutes after short focus cycles).
    4. Ends with a consistent pattern of 25-5-25-5 (minutes) for focus-break cycles but it's not always
       same pattern, for cases when we focus for less than 90 minutes, we will have
       [50,10,25,5]. here we only have 25-5 one time because there is no time left for the
       other 25-5 cycle.
    5. Adjusts to fit within the specified total time while maintaining the core structure.
    6. Distributes extra time based on user preferences.

    Args:
    total_hours (int): The total number of hours for the session.
    minutes (int): Additional minutes for the session.
    distribute_extra_time_to_long_cycles (bool): Distribute extra time to long focus cycles.

    distribute_extra_time_to_last_25_5_25_5_cycles (bool): Distribute extra time to the final 25-5-25-5 cycles.
    user: The user object, used for timezone information.

    Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the generated cycles, total cycle count, and additional information.
